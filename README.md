# Unit-Converter
This is a single page web application that converts basic units. It was built with a mobile-first approach, but may be rough around the edges as it was my first time trying such an approach. So far, it can convert **length**, **time**, and **mass** units (I may add more unit variety later on). I used HTML5, CSS3, SASS, vanillaJS, and jQuery on this project. I scripted the JavaScript portion both in vanillaJS and jQuery so either can be used (but not together).
